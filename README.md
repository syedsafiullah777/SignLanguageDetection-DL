# 🤟 Sign Language Detection Using Deep Learning

## 📌 Introduction
Communication is one of the most essential parts of daily life. For individuals who are deaf or hard of hearing, **sign language** serves as a powerful means of expression. However, communication barriers can arise because many people do not understand sign language — especially in public spaces such as schools, hospitals, or workplaces.  
With the advancement of **Computer Vision** and **Deep Learning**, machines can now learn to interpret hand gestures. This project aims to recognize and classify **sign language gestures**, acting as a bridge between signers and non-signers to promote **inclusive communication**.

## 🚀 How to Run the Project
